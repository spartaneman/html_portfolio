<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello I am Emanuel Ruiz and I recently graduated from California State University-Long Beach with a B.S in Computer Science.
  I am excited to venture out into the world and fine a career that make a difference in the world. I would like to find a career where 
  my voice is heard and where the team collaborates to reach a single goal, a place that works together instead of working against each other. 

</p>

<p>I have a strong foundation in programming practices such as object oriented programming. I have experience working with
  Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Kotlin. I have worked with SQL and NoSql databases. I am currently expanding my 
  developer toolkit by taking two fullstack courses. I am doing a fullstack course in Udemy and one in Coursera. 
</p>

<p>I enjoy programming and seeing the outcome of my work translate to the screen. I also enjoy playing video games and working out. 
  For my upperbody I do weights, while for my lower body I usually do indoor bike, running, running up stairs, sprints.
